# GibberishEncryptor
A short project for my CS principles class which translates a message into different "gibberish" languages using the Python GUI toolkit Tkinter.

## Instructions
1. Type out your plaintext message
2. Select a language to translate the message into

... [Verlan](https://www.fluentu.com/blog/french/french-verlan/)

... [Pig Latin](https://www.wikihow.com/Speak-Pig-Latin)

... ["Compression" Language](http://mentalfloss.com/article/64730/some-srs-bsns-are-words-without-vowels-rlly-more-efficient)

... [Jeringonza](https://www.mamalisa.com/blog/jeringonza-a-spanish-word-game-like-pig-latin/)

3. Receive your translation!

## How to Download:
1. After navigating to this repository, select the green button to the top-right of the screen and choose "Download as Zip"
2. Unzip the file and move the "gibberish" file to your C: drive
3. Ensure that your computer runs the most recent version of Python 3.6
4. Click the gibberish_encryption.py to run the program!

*If the program does not run properly, open the gibberish_encryption.py file with any text editor and confirm that the line
  ```
  title_image = ImageTk.PhotoImage(Image.open("C:/gibberish/title_image.gif"))
  ```
  leads to the location of title_image.gif in your computer. You may need to change this. 
  Hint: the title image should be the same file path as "gibberish_encryption.py"
